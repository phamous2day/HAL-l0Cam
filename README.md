##Obstacles:
There were a lot of moving parts to this project. I figure the best approach is to take it one milestone at a time.

###1. Finding resources to work with
First issue was not having the right equipment (some IP cameras don't give me the necessaary information I need, e.g. FOSCam cameras didn't provide IP address or other ways to extract information. They were limited by their app). Eventually, I did find a website that has a "still image feed" here:
https://www.cedarpoint.com/online-fun/live-video-cam

To capture the images say every 8 seconds, I used setInterval which looks like this:
```javascript
var i = 0;
setInterval(function() {
  request('http://192.168.1.112/tmpfs/auto.jpg').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('DCCam'+i+'.png'));
  i++;
}, 8000);
```

###2. Uploading files to MongoDB
On my research, I learned about [GridFS](http://excellencenodejsblog.com/gridfs-using-mongoose-nodejs/). To summarize as files are uploaded they are split into 2 chunks: one to store metadata the other to store the files as a "chunk." With the limitation of how much memory I have in the database, I realize to do a videostream would take up too much memory. So, I opted for still images instead, leading me to ditch GridFS.

When images are stored to something like MongoDB, they aren't stored as actual images. Instead, they're stored as either binary or "buffers." To convert the buffers to images on the front end, it'll invole 'base64':

**Backend**
```javascript
app.get('/images', function(request, response, next) {
  Image.find()
  .then(function(images) {
    images = images.map(function(image) {
      return {
        timestamp: image.timestamp,
        data: image.data.toString('base64')
      };
    });
    response.json(images);
  })
  .catch(next);
});
```

IMPORTANT: when working with base64 conversion, you'll encounter errors in the browser console that mentions how "unsafe" the urls are. To sanitize the image links, it'll look like this:
>imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist([regexp]); 

*from https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/provider/$compileProvider

With the way my code was written, I had to chop some things out to make it less specific. I made the parameter below match up to exclusively the image instead of factoring other possible parameters like links.
**Frontend: AngularJS**
```javascript
app.config(function($compileProvider){
  $compileProvider.imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist(/^data:image/);
});
```

>"Retrieves or overrides the default regular expression that is used for whitelisting of safe urls during img[src] sanitization.
>The sanitization is a security measure aimed at prevent XSS attacks via html links.

>Any url about to be assigned to img[src] via data-binding is first normalized and turned into an absolute url. Afterwards, the url is matched against the imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist regular expression. If a match is found, the original url is written into the dom. Otherwise, the absolute url is prefixed with 'unsafe:' string and only then is it written into the DOM.

###3a. Using AngularJS filter to display images based on timestamp
Not having much practice with Date filters (especially since I don't want it to pull everything that comes with it, but rather, a shortened "timestamp" filter which I would have to make), I found a sampling of [how it looks here](http://plnkr.co/edit/vxIewUDGDjiz80W1Itag?p=preview):

Here's what they have:
```javascript
function MainController($scope) {

  $scope.year = 2015;
  $scope.combinations = [
    { name : 'a', date: new Date(2015, 3, 1) },
    { name : 'b', date: new Date(2015, 3, 1) },
    { name : 'c', date: new Date(2014, 3, 1) },
    ];

  $scope.ofYear = function(year) {
      return function(c) {
        return c.date.getFullYear() === year;
      }
  }
  
  $scope.next = function() {
    $scope.year++;  
  }
  
  $scope.prev = function() {
    $scope.year--;  
  }
}
```
In the above example, they inserted a hard-coded year to be 2015, their "combinations" is set to a static array of values,

**Here's what I changed it to:**
```javascript
function MainController($scope, $http) {
  $http.get('/images')
  .success(function(data,status){
    $scope.Images = data;

    $scope.ofTimestamp = function(image) {
        return image.timestamp >= $scope.timestamp;
    };
    $scope.next = function() {
      $scope.timestamp++;
    };
    $scope.prev = function() {
      $scope.timestamp--;
    };
  });
}
```
I'm going to the timestamp based on user input. I'm not using a static array of predefined values to be looped through, since I already hav that made with the $scope.Images which stores a buffer of images I stored in my database.

Note to self: What mongodb query looks like to get between dates -
```js
db.getCollection('images').find({
       "timestamp": {
        $gte: ISODate("2016-08-09 18:02:04.359Z"),
        $lt: ISODate("2016-08-09 18:02:24.311Z")
    }
})
```

###3b. Filter images by timestamp: passing front end data to backend.
Components include: build a form to take in start and end time, apply "ng-model" to both times to get the values independently, then $scope the values to the frontend js, then pass those values to the backend server.js

```html
<body ng-app="app" ng-controller="MainController">
  <form>
    Start: <input ng-model="starttime" type="text"  placeholder="Starting point"><br>
    End: <input ng-model="endtime" type="text" placeholder="ending point"><br>
    <button ng-click="getImages()">Get Images</button>
    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="image in Images"> test{{image.timestamp}} <br></br>
        <img ng-src="data:images/PNG;base64,{{image.data}}"></li>
      </ul>
    </form>
```

Frontend JS
```js
$scope.getImages = function() {
    var parameterTimes =
    {
      "$gte": $scope.starttime,
      "$lte": $scope.endtime,
    };

    $http.post('/images', parameterTimes)
    .success(function(data,status){
      $scope.Images = data;
    })
    .error(function(status){
      console.log("status is: " + status);
    });
```
Backend to mongo
```js
app.post('/images', function(request, response, next) {

  Image.find({
    "timestamp": {
      // take timestamp from request.body
      $gte: request.body.$gte,
      $lte: request.body.$lte
    }})
    .then(function(images) {
```

###3c. Using a "datepicker" to make time ranges more elegant
I wanted to use a fancy date time picker to specify the range since it's nearly impossible for users to input an exact timestamp like this format (from the top of their head): 2016-08-09 18:02:24.311Z

After scouring the internet, seems like the general direction was to use "angular UI" ...but that's mostly for display and it's tough to $scope the input time from front end to backend. Then, I found this: [https://codepen.io/Sinetheta/pen/Ftjwi](https://codepen.io/Sinetheta/pen/Ftjwi) which looks really and had everything I needed ... but turns out it used jQuery, and I didn't want to get my code messier with assorted languages.

In the end, I found a "datetime" drop down from W3 school, which looks like this:

```html

<form action="action_page.php">
  Birthday (date and time):
  <input type="datetime" name="bdaytime">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

The issue here is that it uses that specific action_page.php, which I don't want to use. It's a simple fix, instead of telling it that action, I made the form do a: **form methods = "POST"** 

Final Date/Time Range code
```html
<body ng-app="app" ng-controller="MainController">
  <form methods= "POST">
    Starting (date and time):
    <input ng-model="starttime"type="datetime-local" name="startime">

    Ending (date and time):
    <input ng-model="endtime"type="datetime-local" name="endtime">

    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="image in Images"> test{{image.timestamp}} <br></br>
        <img ng-src="data:images/PNG;base64,{{image.data}}"></li>
      </ul>

      <button ng-click="getImages()">Get Images</button>
    </form>
    </body>
```

I also wanted to refine the search to pull just the timestamps rather than a bunch of data. Looking [at MongoDB docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/reference/method/db.collection.find/) I found this snippet â€” the following operation finds documents in the bios collection and returns only the name field and the contribs field:
:
```mongo
db.bios.find(
   { },
   { name: 1, contribs: 1, _id: 0 }
)
```
